# StarTube

StarTube is a userscript that allows you to choose your YouTube layout, currently allowing you to use almost every layout from 2008-2024. It is the official successor to CustomTube.

StarTube is built to be used with Vorapis 2013 (V3), which is a YouTube client that faithfully restores the 2013-2014 YouTube layout, and is also faster than regular YouTube.

[V3 Website](https://vorapis.pages.dev/#/)

[Install StarTube](https://github.com/lightbeam24/StarTube/raw/refs/heads/main/StarTube.user.js)

[Install StarTube Beta](https://github.com/lightbeam24/StarTube/raw/refs/heads/main/StarTube%20Beta.user.js)

[Install StarTube Legacy](https://github.com/lightbeam24/StarTube/raw/refs/heads/main/StarTube%20Legacy.user.js) (Missing features. Only recommended on older browsers, and only if the regular version of StarTube doesn't work for you)

<sub>Note that V3 is closed source. Also note that V3 and StarTube are separate projects with different developers.</sub>

## Installation and usage

### Prerequisites

- Have Tampermonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) installed.

<sub>Note: Violentmonkey seems to work fine as well (though is not actively tested on), but Greasemonkey is known to cause issues.</sub>

### Installing V3

StarTube requires V3 to function.

See: https://vorapis.pages.dev/#/home/download

If you try using StarTube without V3, a warning banner will appear on regular YouTube telling you to Install V3:

### Changing your layout (or accessing the settings in general)

There are a few ways to access StarTube's settings, but the recommended way is by clicking on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser's toolbar, as this method works on all layouts.

Once you've opening StarTube's settings, simply set it the way you want it, and then refresh the page to apply your newly changed settings.
